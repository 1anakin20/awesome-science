# Contributing to awesome-science

The README is divided into 3 parts with each part having other subparts. Feel free to contribute to any of these parts. All you need is the link to the resource.

## Structure

The project is structured into three subjects - General Science, Physical Science and Life Science. Each of these subjects have under it a bunch of other sub-topics. Before contributing, you should check under which topic your resource will belong.

## Adding a resource under a sub-topic

Each sub-topic has under it, Tutorials, Textbooks/books, Useful Links and YouTube Channels. Feel free to add your topic in any of these with the following formatting:

```- [<name of the resource>](https://example.link.com/xyz/abc) - <short, one or two line description of the resource>```

Please also make sure it is in proper alphabetical order!

### What type of content is not allowed?

We do not encourage resources including religion, metaphysics and/or pseudoscience. Any resource relating to this will be removed.
